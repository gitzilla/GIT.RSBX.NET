The "As If" Principle
=====================

	It has been found that describing various aspects of the
	intended behavior in terms of concrete models best serves
	discussion and presentation. Every attempt has been made to
	craft the models so that implementors are constrained only
	insofar as they must bring about the same result, as if they had
	implemented the presentation model; often enough the clearest
	model would make for the worst implementation.
